It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it.
                JavaScript is a <u>weakly typed language</u> <b>(Dinamically types)</b>. JavaScript can be used for <u>Client-side</u> development as well as <u>Server-side</u> developments. JavaSript is both an imperative and declarative type of language.
                <ul>
                <li><b>Client-side</b>: It supplies objects to control a browser and its <u>Document Object Model (DOM)</u>. Like if client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTMK form and respond to uer events such as <b>mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation</b>. Usefull libraries for the client-side are <b>AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS</b>,  and so many others./li>
                <li><b>Server-side</b>: It supplies object relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For if the server-side extensions allow an applications to communicate with a database, ans provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. The useful framework which is the most famous these days is <b>node.JS</b>.</li>
                <li><b>Imperative Language</b>: In this type of language we are mostlu concerned about how it is to be done. it simply controls the flow of computation. The procedural programming approach, object, oriented approach comes under this as async await we are thinking about what is to be done further after the async call.</li>

It allows you to apply styles to HTML documents, describing how a webpage should look by prescribing colors, fonts, spacing and positioning. CSS provides developers and designers with powerfull control over the presentation of HTML elements.
                HTML uses tage and CSS uses rulesets. CSS styles are applied to the HTML element using selectors. CSS is easy to learn and understand, but it provides powerfull control over the presentation of an HTML document.
                <strong>Why CSS?</strong>
                <ul>
                <li>Saves time: Write CSS once and reuse it across multiple HTML pages.</li>
                <li>Easy maintenance: Change the style globally with a single modification.</li>
                <li>Search engine friendly: Clean coding technique that improves readability for search engines.</li>
                <li>Superior styles: offer a wider array of attributes compared to HTML.</li>
